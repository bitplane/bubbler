Bubbler by Gaz Davidson 2012
----------------------------

I've taped a mic to the airlock on my homebrew wine in order to capture
the sound of the bubbles. The aim is to count the number of bubbles, which
when combined with my USB thermometer should allow me to brew with science.

The variables involved are CO2 released (bubble count), temperature, 
amount of sugar being fermented, type and amount of yeast used, type of and
amount of nutrient used, plus the solution ph.

If this all seems a bit convoluted and crazy, you're probably right. I'm
a bit obsessed with measuring things and making pretty graphs.
